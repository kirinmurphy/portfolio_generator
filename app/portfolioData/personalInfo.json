  "introduction": "I think I was in love once.  She was Brazilian, or Chinese, or something weird. I met her in the bathroom of a K-Mart and we made out for hours. Then we parted ways, never to see each other again. \n\n I know that synergy is a completely made-up word. I know that washing your hands is for nerds, especially if you donâ€™t mind pinkeye. And I know, that no matter what, you always stand by your friends.",
